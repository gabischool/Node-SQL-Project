# Node Project Four

## Introduction

In this Project, you will write an API that can be used to manage _Cars_ stored in a Relational Database and You will also write some SQL statements in the `queries.sql` file.

## Instructions

### Minimum Viable Product

Build a RESTful API for an "cars" resource. The client for this API is a car dealer.
Write the statements mentioned below as a SQL Query using the w3schools website.

#### Cars Schema

The critical information for each car is the vin, make, model, and mileage. They also track transmission type (manual, automatic...) and status of the title (clean, salvage...), but this information is not always immediately known. Write the "up" and "down" functions inside the `data/migrations/01-make_cars_table.js` migration file to satisfy the following schema:

| field        | data type        | metadata                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| vin          | string           | required, unique                                    |
| make         | string           | required                                            |
| model        | string           | required                                            |
| mileage      | numeric          | required                                            |
| title        | string           | optional                                            |
| transmission | string           | optional                                            |

#### Write Model Functions

- Write the following db access functions inside `api/cars/cars-model.js` using Knex:

  - `getAll` resolves to an array of car records (or an empty array)
  - `getById` resolves to a car record by the given id
  - `create` resolves to the newly created car record


### Write a Cars API

- Write CRUD for the `cars` resource inside `api/cars/cars-router.js` :

  - `[GET] /api/cars` returns an array of cars sorted by id (or an empty array if there aren't any).
  - `[GET] /api/cars/:id` returns a car by the given id.
  - `[POST] /api/cars` returns the created car.

- Manually test your endpoints with a REST client like `Insomnia` or `Postman` to check they are working as expected.

### Write Basic SQL Queries

Visit [SQL Try Editor at W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) using Chrome and build the queries below. Once they work copy them to the `queries.sql` file at the root of the project.

- Find all customers with postal code 1010. Returns 3 records.
- [ ] ` SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE PostalCode = 1010; `
- Find the phone number for the supplier with the id 11. Should be (010) 9984510.
- [ ] ` `
- List first 10 orders placed, sorted descending by the order date. The order with date 1997-02-12 should be at the top.
- [ ] `SELECT * FROM Orders ORDER BY OrderDate DESC;`
- Find all customers that live in London, Madrid, or Brazil. Returns 18 records.
- [ ] `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City ='London' OR City = 'Madrid' OR Country ='Brazil'; `
- Add a customer record for _"Yusuf Ali"_, the contact name is _"Yusuf Ali"_ the address is _"123 Somali Street"_ in _"Somalia"_, postal code _"111"_ and the country is _"Somalia"_.
- [ ] `INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address,City, PostalCode, Country)
Values ("Yusuf Ali","Yusuf Ali","123 Somali Street","Somalia",111,"Somalia")`
- Update _Yusuf Ali_ record so that the postal code changes to _"11122"_.
- [ ] `UPDATE Customers SET PostalCode = "11122" WHERE CustomerID = 92;`
**Clicking the `Restore Database` button in the page will repopulate the database with the original data and discard all changes you have made**.

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

- Add seed data to the database using `knex seeds`
- Add `[PUT]` and `[DELETE]` operations to your API.
- Write a schema file for a `sales` table. This table should track information on the sale of each car. You may wish to research `foreign keys` in order to link each sale to the entry in `cars` which sold.
